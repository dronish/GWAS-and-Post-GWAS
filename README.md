Software Overview:
Developed in Python, the software features a GUI interface implemented using the Tkinter library.
It offers three core functionalities:

Key Functional Allele Screening: Users can perform association analysis using genome variation data (VCF format) and phenotypic information. The built-in analysis models enable rapid identification of key functional alleles and visualization of results.
Functional Annotation of Key Alleles: This function allows users to quickly annotate variation information and determine the detailed impact of allele variations.
Primer Design for Allele Amplification: Users can freely design basic amplification primers and molecular marker primers. Additionally, the software provides a quick access to BLAST for subsequent analysis.
Installation Instructions:
The compiled version of this software has been uploaded to GitHub. Simply download the compiled software package, extract it, and you're ready to use it.
